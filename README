1. About
=========

WUMprep4Weka is a project aiming at the smooth integration of WUMprep, a 
powerful tool suite for Web log file processing and analysis, with Weka, a 
collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks 
(see http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/).

WUMprep4Weka is available both as a standalone plugin for Weka that requires
manual installation of Weka and WUMprep, and as a pre-packaged release of Weka 
(called "Weka-WP4W") that contains everything you need for using WUMprep4Weka
but the Perl and Java runtime environments.


2. Installation
================

Please follow the instructions given in the INSTALL file.


3. Usage
=========

There is no user documentation yet - sorry!

However, this is how to start: 

 * Install WUMprep4Weka (see before).
 
 * In the Weka GUI Chooser, click on "KnowledgeFlow".
 
 * Select the "Data Sources" tab, select "WeblogLoader" from the 
   "org.hypknowsys" group of nodes and drop it on the KnowledgeFlow workspace.
   
 * Right-click the WeblogLoader node and select "Configure".
 
 * At the bottom of the configuration dialog, specify where you have installed
   WUMprep (if you are using Weka-WP4W, this should correct path should be
   initialized automatically). You'll have to set this only once as long as you
   don't want to switch between differnt versions of WUMprep.
   
 * Use the configuration dialog for setting the log file template and the log
   file to import.
   
 * Close the configuration dialog.
 
 * Switch to the "Filter" tab and select one of the WUMprep4Weka filters in the 
   "org.hypknowsys" group. Drop this filter on the KnowledgeFlow workspace.
   
 * Right-click the WeblogLoader node, select "data set", and the click the 
   filter creating the data flow from the loader to the filter.
   
 * You can add further (WUMprep4Weka) filters as you need.
 
 * In order to view the results of a WUMprep filter, add a TextView viewer from 
   the "Visualize" tab and connect the filter's data stream to it.
   
 * In order to export the results of your WUMprep stream back to a log file,
   use the WeblogSaver node from the "Data Sinks" tab.
   
   
4. Diagnosing Errors
=====================
   
The WUMprep scripts write diagnostical messages to the error output, which is 
displayed in the KnowledgeFlow log (which you can open via the "Log" button at 
the lower right corner of the KnowledgeFlow window).
   
  ALLWAYS FIRST CHECK THE LOG IF SOMETHING DOES NOT RUN AS EXPECTED!

Also check the console output of Weka. It might provide useful hints about what 
caused the error.

When asking the hypKNOWsys team for support, please be prepared to be asked for 
each of the above logs plus the input files you're trying to process (both the 
log and the logfileTemplate).

Another helpful tool might be the TextViewer node. Just connect it to the 
suspicious WUMprep4Weka node's data output and see what arrives when running
the KnowledgeFlow.


6. Credits
===========

The hypKNOWsys team would like to thank Mark Hall for including the changes 
necessary to make WUMprep4Weka run into the official Weka distribution.
